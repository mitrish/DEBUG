<p>
There are two types of problems:<br>
a. The ones that are covered in the live session<br> 
b. The problems to be practised after the session<br>
Everyone is encouraged to go through the problems and solve them. There will be solution vidoes for selected problems.<br>
If anyone has any doubt can raise a it in the group without any hesitation. it is better to "look stupid" now than to be "stupid" in future.<br>
The content covered in the sessions and resources used will also be shared here, if anyone misses the session can look up to it and one can use to revise the concepts as well.<br>
The required resources will be put up which will help you solve the problems. It is highly encourged for you to go through these resources even if you  are well aware of the concept.<br>
